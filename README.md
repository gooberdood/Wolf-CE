# Wolf-CE
Wolfenstein 3D for the TI-84+ CE graphing calculator. Made by ID-Software, rewritten by gooberdev

Currently just a crappy unfinished raycasting engine that doesn't render properly, made it in a few hours for a school project.

I plan on developing this further eventually but for now it will stand as a testament to how bad I am at finishing projects.
